# CSC 871 – Deep Learning (Spring 2026)

This repository contains my homework submissions for the graduate-level course **CSC 871: Deep Learning** at SFSU. Each assignment includes the instructions, my solution code, and a full report written in Typst (both source and compiled PDF).

## Repository Structure

Each assignment is organized in its own directory:

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.12**
- **PyTorch** – for vectorized linear algebra
- **Matplotlib** – for generating plots
- **Typst** – for writing professional, LaTeX‑quality reports

## How to Compile a Typst Report

If you wish to recompile any of the reports, install [Typst](https://typst.app/) and run:

```bash
cd hwX/
typst compile report.typ
```
